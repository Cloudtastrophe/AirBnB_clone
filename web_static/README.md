AirBnB Clone - Web Static
Overview
This project is part of the ongoing second chance projects and was started on Mar 14, 2024, with a deadline to be completed by Mar 25, 2024. The objective is to develop a front-end for the AirBnB clone using HTML and CSS. Manual QA review must be conducted upon completion of the project.

Background Context
In this phase of the project, we aim to bring life to the AirBnB objects by creating the front end step-by-step. The initial focus will be on designing, sketching, and prototyping each element through simple HTML static pages. This includes creating a style guide and incorporating fake contents. The project excludes the use of Javascript and loading data from external sources.

Guidelines
Before diving into styling, it's essential to focus on structuring the HTML pages properly. HTML forms the backbone of the webpage, providing the necessary structure. Once the HTML structure is in place, CSS can be applied to enhance the design and aesthetics.

Populate the pages with fake contents to simulate real-world scenarios.
Ensure that no JavaScript is used, and data is not loaded from external sources.
Conclusion
By the end of this project, you will have gained proficiency in manipulating HTML and CSS languages. The project serves as a foundational step towards developing a fully functional and visually appealing web application.
